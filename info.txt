This is my professional website, designed for my COM 421 (Technical Communication) class. I have a homepage and resume page. My homepage consists of a picture of me and my mom (I will change this when I get a better headshot of me) and a short bio of me. My resume page contains the same header from my homepage as well as the contents of my resume. The navigation bar at the top of my pages include my name, contact info, and links to my homepage and resume page. On my resume page, there is an additional link to download the pdf version of my resume. I really am not the most satisfied of my website. Unfortunately I got caught up with some of my other classes and did not have as much time to work on this as I wanted to. If I had managed my time better, I would have liked to add more design elements to my website. My homepage is lacking in material and I would have liked to include more content on that page. I wanted to include a sidebar menu and put my contact info there instead. I also would have liked to link my github page in that side menu. On my resume page, I would have probably kept the content mostly the same but I would have liked to do more stuff with different colors (mess around with different color scheme and color blocking).
